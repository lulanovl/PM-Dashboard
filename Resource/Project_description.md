General description:
Theme: Project management/profiles dashboard - a service to create, update, share, and delete projects information (details, attached documents)


Stack:
Python3.10
FastAPI
PostgreSQL + Optional ORM (SQLAlchemy, etc)



Desired functionality:
User login/auth
Create/Delete projects
Add/Update project’s info/details - name, description
Add/Update/Remove projects documents (docx, pdf)



API:
POST /auth - Create user (login, password, repeat password)
POST /login - Login into service (login, password)
POST /projects - Create project from details (name, description). Automatically gives access to created project to user, making him the owner (admin of the project).
GET /projects - Get all projects, accessible for a user. Returns list of projects full info(details + documents).
GET /project/<project_id>/info - Return project’s details, if user has access
PUT /project/<project_id>/info - Update projects details - name, description. Returns the updated project’s info
DELETE /project/<project_id>- Delete project, can only be performed by the projects’ owner. Deletes the corresponding documents
GET /project/<project_id>/documents- Return all of the project's documents
POST /project/<project_id>/documents - Upload document/documents for a specific project
GET /document/<document_id> - Download document, if the user has access to the corresponding project
PUT /document/<document_id> - Update document
DELETE /document/<document_id> - Delete document and remove it from the corresponding project
POST /project/<project_id>/invite?user=<login> - Grant access to the project for a specific user. If the request is not coming from the owner of the project, results in error. Granting access gives participant permissions to receiving user



Optional:
GET /project/<project_id>/share?with=<email> - send a GET /join link with correct hashed token for the requested project to specified email, that can be opened by a different user in a browser



Implementation notes:
All the business logic requests should be authorized via JWT (including resolving access permissions), issued by POST /login. JWT should last 1 hour.
All the returned data must be in JSON format (except for file data) + proper http status codes
2 types of access – owner (creator of the project, can do anything) and participant (user invited to the project, can modify, cannot delete)
Exact API parameters/endpoints can be changed/updated upon agreement with the mentor, as long as they cover the described logic
